A link is just that, a symbolic link.  The purpose of the link
command is that you should be able to work with local
dependencies.

For example, let's say you are developing an Emacs package that
depends on f.el. Consider what happens if you need to extend f.el
with some function that your package requires.

With the link command, you can checkout f.el locally, add it as a
link in your local package.  That means that when you require
f.el, you will require the local package instead of the one
fetched from the Elpa mirror.  Now you add the desired function
to f.el and use your library to try it out.

COMMAND-OR-NAME can be one of: delete, list a link name.
ARG is sent to some of the commands.

Commands:

 $ cask link list

  List all project links.

 $ cask link name path

  Add local link with NAME to PATH.

 $ cask link delete name

  Delete local link with NAME."
