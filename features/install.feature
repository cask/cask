    And I go to the project called "install"

    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Could not locate `Cask` file
      """

    Given this Cask file:
      """
      """

      """
      (source "localhost" "http://127.0.0.1:9191/packages/")

      (depends-on "foo" "0.0.1")
      """
    When I run cask "install"
    Then there should exist a package directory called "foo-0.0.1"

      (depends-on "bar" "0.0.2")
      """

    Then there should exist a package directory called "foo-0.0.1"
    And there should exist a package directory called "bar-0.0.2"
