Feature: Package
  In order to quickly create a -pkg.el file
  As a Cask user
  I want to create it automatically

  Background:
    Given I create a project called "package"
    And I go to the project called "package"

  Scenario: No Cask file
    When I run cask "package"
    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Could not locate `Cask` file
      """

  Scenario: Empty Cask file
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      """
    When I run cask "package"
    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Missing `package` or `package-file` directive
      """

  Scenario: Using package directive no dependencies
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      (package "super-project" "0.0.1" "Super project.")
      """
    When I run cask "package"
    Then there should exist a file called "super-project-pkg.el" with this content:
      """
      (define-package "super-project" "0.0.1"
        "Super project.")
      """

  Scenario: Using package directive with dependencies
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      (package "super-project" "0.0.1" "Super project.")
      
      (depends-on "foo" "0.1.2")
      (depends-on "bar" "0.2.1")
      """
    When I run cask "package"
    Then there should exist a file called "super-project-pkg.el" with this content:
      """
      define-package "super-project" "0.0.1"
        "Super project."
        '((foo "0.1.2") (bar "0.2.1")))
      """

  Scenario: Using package-file directive
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      (package-file "super-project.el")
      """
    When I create a file called "super-project.el" with content:
      """
      ;;; super-project.el --- Super project.
