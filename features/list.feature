Feature: List
  In order to quickly get an overview of all dependencies
  As a Cask user
  I want to list them

  Background:
    Given I create a project called "list"
    And I go to the project called "list"

  Scenario: No Cask file
    When I run cask "list"
    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Could not locate `Cask` file
      """

  Scenario: No dependencies
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      """
    When I run cask "list"
    Then I should see command output:
      """
      ### Dependencies ###
