Feature: Version
  In order to quickly get the project version
  As a Cask user
  I want to print it

  Background:
    Given I create a project called "version"
    And I go to the project called "version"

  Scenario: No Cask file
    When I run cask "version"
    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Could not locate `Cask` file
      """

  Scenario: Empty Cask file
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      """
    When I run cask "version"
    Then I should see command error:
      """
      Missing `package` or `package-file` directive
      """

  Scenario: Using package directive
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      (package "super-project" "0.0.1" "Super project.")
      """
    When I run cask "version"
    Then I should see command output:
      """
      0.0.1
      """

  Scenario: Using package-file directive
    Given this Cask file:
      """
      (package-file "super-project.el")
      """
    When I create a file called "super-project.el" with content:
      """
      ;;; super-project.el --- Super project.
