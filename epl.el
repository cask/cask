;;; Commentary:

;; A package management library for Emacs, based on package.el.

;; The purpose of this library is to wrap all the quirks and hassle of
;; package.el into a sane API.

;; The following functions comprise the public interface of this library:

;; `epl-package-p' determines whether an object is a package object.

;; `epl-package-name' gets the package name from a package object.

;; `epl-package-summary' gets the package summary from a package object.

;; `epl-package-version' gets the package version from a package object.

;; `epl-package-version-string' gets the package version as string from a
;; package object.

;; `epl-package-requirements' gets the requirements of a package.

;; `epl-package-installed-p' determines whether a package is installed.

;; `epl-initialize' initializes the package system and activates all
;; packages.

;; `epl-reset' resets the package system.

;; `epl-refresh' refreshes all package archives.

;; `epl-package-dir' gets the directory of packages.

;; `epl-default-package-dir' gets the default package directory.

;; `epl-change-package-dir' changes the directory of packages.

;; `epl-add-archive' adds a new package archive.

;; `epl-installed-packages' and `epl-available-packages' get all packages
;; installed and available for installed respectively.

;; `epl-find-installed-package' and `epl-find-available-packages' find installed
;; and available packages by name.

;; `epl-find-upgrades' finds all upgradable packages.

;; `epl-package-install' installs a package.

;; `epl-package-delete' deletes a package.

;; `epl-upgrade' upgrades packages.

;; This version of the EPL library requires a recent package.el which provides
;; the `package-desc' struct.  Loading it with a legacy package.el signals an
;; error.

;;; Code:

;; Declare our error symbol
(eval-and-compile
  ;; We must make the error symbol available during compilation to support the
  ;; conditional loading of the right EPL implementation.
  (put 'epl-error 'error-conditions '(error epl-error))
  (put 'epl-error 'error-message "EPL Error"))

(defun epl-error (string &rest args)
  "Signal an EPL error.

Signal an error with `epl-error' type.

STRING is a `format' string, and ARGS are the formatted objects.

This function does not return."
  (signal 'epl-error (list (apply #'format string args))))
