;;; Commentary:

;; A package management library for Emacs, based on package.el.

;; The purpose of this library is to wrap all the quirks and hassle of
;; package.el into a sane API.

;; The following functions comprise the public interface of this library:

;; `epl-package-p' determines whether an object is a package object.

;; `epl-package-name' gets the package name from a package object.

;; `epl-package-symmary' gets the package summary from a package object.

;; `epl-package-version' gets the package version from a package object.

;; `epl-package-version-string' gets the package version as string from a
;; package object.

;; `epl-package-requirements' gets the requirements of a package.

;; `epl-package-installed-p' determines whether a package is installed.

;; `epl-initialize' initializes the package system and activates all
;; packages.

;; `epl-reset' resets the package system.

;; `epl-refresh' refreshes all package archives.

;; `epl-package-dir' gets the directory of packages.

;; `epl-default-package-dir' gets the default package directory.

;; `epl-change-package-dir' changes the directory of packages.

;; `epl-add-archive' adds a new package archive.

;; `epl-installed-packages' and `epl-available-packages' get all packages
;; installed and available for installed respectively.

;; `epl-find-installed-package' and `epl-find-available-package' find installed
;; and available packages by name.

;; `epl-find-upgrades' finds all upgradable packages.

;; `epl-install' installs a package.

;; `epl-delete' deletes a package.

;; `epl-upgrade' upgrades packages.

;; This version of the EPL library requires a recent package.el which provides
;; the `package-desc' struct.  Loading it with a legacy package.el signals an
;; error.

;;; Code:


;;;; Load package.el

(require 'package)

(setq package-archives nil)             ; Clear the default list of archives to
                                        ; let the user have exact control over
                                        ; all archives


;;;; Compatibility check

;; Declare our error symbol
(put 'epl-error 'error-conditions '(error))

(unless (fboundp 'package-desc-create)
  ;; The package-desc structure is missing, hence indicate that this API cannot
  ;; be loaded
  (signal 'epl-error "Legacy package.el API detected"))
