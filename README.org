Cask can be likened to =venv= or =maven= for Emacs Lisp development, although, as with all things emacs, is decidedly less sophisticated (but no less arcane).

Cask simplifies sandboxing that more expert elisp developers accomplish directly with emacs's built-in =-Q=, =--batch=, and =--eval= switches.  Within the sandbox, Cask provisions dependencies via a user-defined "Cask" file analogous to =requirements-dev.txt= or =pom.xml=.

** Installation

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/cask/cask
  make -C cask install
#+end_src

** Not-so-quick start
With just this baseline "Cask" file, you can run most of the commands described in [[http://cask.readthedocs.io]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(package-file "your-main-file.el")
#+end_src

** Typical Makefile Usage

Egregious boilerplate follows:

#+begin_src makefile :tangle README.makefile
export EMACS ?= $(shell which emacs)
CASK_DIR := $(shell cask package-directory)

$(CASK_DIR): Cask
	cask install
	@touch $(CASK_DIR)

.PHONY: cask
cask: $(CASK_DIR)

.PHONY: compile
compile: cask
	! (cask eval "(let ((byte-compile-error-on-warn t)) \
	                 (cask-cli/build))" 2>&1 \
	   | egrep -a "(Warning|Error):") ; \
	  (ret=$$? ; cask clean-elc && exit $$ret)

.PHONY: test
test: compile
	cask exec ert-runner help
#+end_src

** Typical CI Usage

Cask, in conjunction with [[https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs][setup-emacs]], is commonly used in Github Actions.  Egregious boilerplate follows:

#+begin_src yaml :tangle .github/workflows/readme.yml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        emacs-version:
          - 26.3
          - 27.2
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
        with:
          version: ${{ matrix.emacs-version }}
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        id: cache-cask-packages
        with:
          path: .cask
          key: cache-cask-packages-000
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        id: cache-cask-executable
        with:
          path: ~/.cask
          key: cache-cask-executable-000
      - uses: cask/setup-cask@master
        if: steps.cache-cask-executable.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        with:
          version: snapshot
      - run: echo "$HOME/.cask/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
#+end_src

** Frequently Asked Questions

+ Why is everything you say inconsistent with cask.readthedocs.io? :: I would disregard nearly everything at cask.readthedocs.io, especially the [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/usage.html#quickstart][Quickstart page]].  In particular, I would not =require cask= in your dot.emacs since cask is now largely a command-line tool independent of whatever you do within emacs.  If you are calling =cask-initialize= in your dot.emacs or harken back to the bygone era of [[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][pallet]], I'm afraid you're on your own.
+ Why must I replicate dependencies in the Cask file? :: You mustn't, but probably more than half of Cask deployments in the wild needlessly do.  =cask list= automatically shows your package's dependencies if you specify them /pro forma/ in a =Package-Requires= header.  The oft-confused [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/dsl.html#el.function.development][development stanza]]  is analogous to =requirements-dev.txt=.  Only packages required by your testing apparatus, e.g., =ert-runner=, should be added there.
+ Doesn't Cask make things more complicated? :: Yes, because it forces you to test your package under multiple versions of emacs.  Most packages don't do any testing at all, which is why emacs has lost credibility with the computing public.
+ Is Cask a vassal of MELPA? :: Yes, Cask's early development history is intertwined with that of MELPA's [[https://github.com/melpa/package-build/blob/master/package-build.el][package-build]].  Cask employs that module for all packaging tasks including dependency provisioning.
