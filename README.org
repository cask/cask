Cask is a project management tool for Emacs that helps automate the
package development cycle; development, dependencies, testing, building,
packaging and more.

Cask can also be used to manage dependencies for your local Emacs configuration.

To install Cask, run this command:

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/cask/cask ~/.cask
  PATH=$HOME/.cask/bin:$PATH

  # If you want to make it permanent
  echo 'PATH=$HOME/.cask/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
#+end_src

Or if you are on a Mac, you can install Cask via Homebrew:

#+begin_src shell
  brew install cask
#+end_src

See [[http://cask.readthedocs.io/]] for more information and
