;; A simple stub ELPA server for Cask's integration tests.

;;; Code:

(require 'f)
(require 'servant)
(require 'rx)

(let* ((port 9191)
       (host "127.0.0.1")
       (directory (f-parent (f-this-file)))
       (tmp-directory (f-join directory "tmp"))
       (routes (--map
                (cons (format "^.*//%s/\\(.*\\)$" (regexp-quote it))
                      (servant-make-elnode-handler (f-join directory it)))
                '("packages" "new-packages"))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "q") (lambda ()
                              (interactive)
                              (elnode-stop port)
                              (kill-emacs 0)))

  (insert
   (format "Running (fake) ELPA server on port %d... Press `q' to quit." port))

  (elnode-start (lambda (httpcon) (elnode-hostpath-dispatcher httpcon routes))
                :port port :host host)

  (when noninteractive
    (f-mkdir tmp-directory)
    (with-temp-file (f-join tmp-directory "servant.pid")
      (insert (format "%s" (emacs-pid))))
    ;; Start "event loop".
    (while t
      ;; We need `while' due to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14698081/
