package development cycle; development, dependencies, testing,
building, packaging and more.

Cask can also be used to manage dependencies for your local Emacs
configuration.

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
```

Or if you are on a Mac, you can install Cask via Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install cask
```
