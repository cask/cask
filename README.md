Cask is a tool for managing dependencies in Emacs, both your local
Emacs installation and Emacs package development. It's similar to
Ruby's Bundler and node's npm.

To install Cask, run this command:

```bash
$ curl -fsSkL https://raw.github.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
```

See <http://cask.github.io/> for more information and
